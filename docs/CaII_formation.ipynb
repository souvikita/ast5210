    "## Working with different atom files\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen before that atoms can be either `PASSIVE` or `ACTIVE`. `ACTIVE` means they will be treated in full non-LTE, while `PASSIVE` are only included in background opacity calculations if their transitions are covered by a wavelength used in the calculations (determined by the `ACTIVE` atoms). \n",
    "\n",
    "For completeness, we will include a few large atoms as `PASSIVE`. Create a new `atoms.input` file with the following atom files:\n",

    "* MgII-IRIS.atom\n",
    "* CaII_PRD.atom\n",

    "* He.atom\n",
    "* N.atom\n",
    "* Na.atom\n",
    "* S.atom\n",
    "\n",
    "These are available in the `../../Atoms` directory, so adjust the paths. Use `LTE_POPULATIONS` for all but the H, Ca II and Mg II atoms (use `ZERO_RADIATION` for these). The population file column can be left empty, but adjust the `Nmetal` value at the start of `atoms.input`. Set only `CaII_PRD.atom` as `ACTIVE` and run RH.\n",

    "## Selecting wavelengths for detailed output\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the output from the previous run. Chose a line of Ca II to work with (e.g. Ca II H or Ca II 854.2 nm). To examine the output in detail not all wavelengths are written to disk (to save space), so we must decide which ones to include. You will need to create a file `ray.input` that contains the indices of wavelengths to be saved. \n",
    "\n",
    "The indices of wavelengths are dependent on the model atoms and other input options, so it is handy to examine the previous run so you can identify the indices. For example, after loading the output into `data`, you can find the indices of 392.8 $< \\lambda <$ 394.0 by doing:"

    "    In the above we make use of `.dropna('height')`, a method in `xarray`. This is only needed when you ran RH with the option `15D_DEPTH_ZCUT = TRUE`. When `TRUE`, RH 1.5D will not include the top of the atmosphere, defined as where the temperature first reaches a temperature equal to `15D_TMAX_CUT`, another option in `keyword.input`. The reasoning for this is to save computer time by removing depth points from the calculation, and prevent any numerical instabilities from large gradients when calculating lines formed in the photosphere or chromosphere. When `15D_DEPTH_ZCUT = TRUE`, the output files will still have arrays that have all the depth points of the input atmosphere. RH 1.5D will write the missing points with a special fill value (typically 9.96921e+36), which `xarray` will interpret as `NaN`. Using `.dropna('height')` will cause `xarray` to exclude points with `NaN` from the calculations.\n",
