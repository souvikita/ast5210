    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In your run directory, we'll use almost the same setup as for the Ca II exercise. First, you need to modify `atoms.input` and set the `MgII-IRIS.atom` as `ACTIVE` (and all other atoms as `PASSIVE`). Now, because we changed the active atom, the wavelengths written to file will be different. This means that the wavelength indices we previously wrote in `ray.input` no longer match what we expected. For simplicity, in this exercise we can use a simple `ray.input` that writes no extra output. You can create a `ray.input` file with only the following:\n",

    "The Mg II h & k lines are formed under partial redistribution (PRD). PRD is a complex topic and is not taught in this introductory course. But for this exercise you only need to activate it in RH. In your `keyword.input` file, find the option `PRD_N_MAX_ITER`. This should be set to zero. Now change it to `PRD_N_MAX_ITER = 3`, and you will activate PRD for atoms that require it. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The wavelengths that RH 1.5D uses depend on the *active* model atoms. In the atom file you can configure the number of   wavelength points that each transition has, as well as how they are distributed. For bound-bound transitions, the parameter `Nlambda` defines how many wavelength points they have. This is the most straightforward way to change the wavelength grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to changing the atom files, there is another mechanism to add more wavelengths: the wavelength files. These files contain a list of additional wavelengths for RH to calculate. They are useful when you want to add lines from lists (see below) that are not covered by the active atoms, when you want to add more wavelengths to a specific line or region, or when you want better control over the wavelength grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using wavelength files\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one wavelength file (or wavelength table) is allowed in RH. To use a wavelength file, you need to set the option `WAVETABLE` equal to the wavelength file. Edit your `keyword.input` file so that `WAVETABLE = ../../Atoms/wave_files/IRIS_NUV_full.wave`. This file contains a list of the IRIS NUV wavelengths, and if you've previously unpacked the archive `rh_ast5210.tar.bz2`, it should be in that directory.\n",

We'd like to make this as realistic as possible and include as many lines as possible. The most correct way to do this is to include atoms of relevant elements with all the necessary transitions and calculate all spectra in NLTE. Unfortunately, this would require a very large number of atoms and at least hundreds of thousands of transitions, requiring many wavelength points and RH 1.5D would probably not finish before you are done with AST5210. A simpler and much faster option is to calculate those lines in LTE and use a line list. Again, LTE is probably not a good approximation for many of the strong spectral lines, but this a tradeoff that we'll have to live with.\n",

Run with this new file and see if you can see a difference in the output intensity.\n",

Now run RH again but with the wavelength file you created (separation 0.001 nm), and see if the lines are better resolved now. How many wavelengths were calculated?\n"

However, even without detailed output it is possible to save an additional quantity that helps us diagnose approximately where the line is formed: the height where the optical depth reaches unity. In `keyword.input` you need to set `15D_WRITE_TAU1 = TRUE` (it should not be enabled by default). Re-run RH and you'll find that the `output_ray.hdf5` has an additional output variable called `tau_one_height`. \n",
